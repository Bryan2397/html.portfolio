<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a 19-year-old college student, I am excited to embark on my journey into the world of programming and web development. 
Having just started learning to code upon entering college, I’ve developed a passion for problem-solving through technology. 
The dynamic nature of web development, with its blend of creativity and logic, fascinates me and motivates 
me to learn as much as I can. While I’m at the beginning of this journey, I am eager to build my skills,
tackle challenges, and eventually build user-friendly web applications that makes people interested.</p>
